  <p>Firefox motion is quick, supportive and whimsical.</p>

  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <h3>Quick</h3>
  <p>
    Animations should be fast and nimble and never keep the user waiting longer than they need to. The aim is to prioritise user perceived performance over technical benchmarks.
  </p>
  <h3>Supportive</h3>
  <p>
    Motion should help ease the user through the experience. It should aid the flow of actions, giving clear guidance for user orientation: spatial or temporal.
  </p>
  <h3>Whimsical</h3>
  <p>
    Animations should have a playful and delightful personality when appropriate.

  <h2>Curve</h2>
  <p>
    A rigidly linear movement looks unnatural to the human eye. Accelerate and decelerate smoothly to help your animation feel more natural.
  </p>
  <h3>Animation Curve</h3>
  <div class="cf nl3 nr3">
  <div class="fl w-50-ns ph3">
    <p>
      In Firefox we use this curve for the majority of animations. Acceleration and deceleration occur asymmetrically to feel natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      We quickly accelerate at the beginning of the animation and slowly decelerate by the end.
    </p>

  <h2>Durations</h2>
  <p>
    Animations should last from 150ms up to 250ms and have to feel quick and responsive. Shorter animations are also more easily compiled by machines, which helps to achieve this feeling.
